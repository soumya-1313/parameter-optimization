# SVM Hyperparameter Tuning on Sensorless Drive Diagnosis Dataset

This project applies hyperparameter optimization on the [Sensorless Drive Diagnosis dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dataset+name) using Support Vector Machines (`NuSVC` from `sklearn`). It explores different strategies to balance model accuracy and training time.

##  Optimization Approach

- Model: `NuSVC` (non-linear SVM with parameter `nu`)
- Methods Tested:
  - `Optuna` (slowest, full Bayesian optimization)
  - `RandomizedSearchCV` (balanced)
  - ‚úÖ **Minimal Manual Loop** (fastest & used in final version)

---

## üìä Results (Summary)

- Accuracy achieved: ~97% with `rbf` kernel and `nu ‚âà 0.1`
- Best kernel: `rbf`
- Convergence stabilizes within 3‚Äì5 parameter trials
